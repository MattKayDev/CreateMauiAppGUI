## Some background
I was getting really frustrated at how in VS Code in order to create MAUI app the tempalte might sometimes show up and sometimes it wouldn't.

# Create Maui App
This simple app allows to create .NET Maui app using a GUI. This is to prevent having to enter command to create it into terminal. 

It was written on Windows but should work fine on Linux as well because it's Python code.
